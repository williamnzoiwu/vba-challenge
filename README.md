This script scrolls through all the stocks from 2018-2020. For each year it displays the ticker symbol, the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. After going through all the data, it then creates a table which displays the stocks with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and the greatest stock value over all. 
The "Yearly Change" column includes code to visually indicate the overall direction of the change. It is designed to color a cell green if filled with a value greater than 0, and red if filled with a value less than zero. The values in the "Percent Change" column are coded to automatically appear in percentage format. The script includes commands to run the code on every worksheet of the document.
